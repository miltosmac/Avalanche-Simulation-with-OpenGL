# Avalanche Simulation with OpenGL

* Unzip external.rar
* CMake is required to generate build files

## Gameplay

* ASWD are used to move around
* Mouse is used to look around
* Press "M" to show cursor
* Point Cursor at Snow and click to start the "Avalanche" (Won't work without cursor, (doesn't work anyway))
* I can't read thw Normal Map correctly to extract the Normal Values and thus the snow only moves in one direction...
